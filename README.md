# day-planner

## Description

A simple Day planner as an exercise in using a number of programming languages. Some of the languages I used are jQuery, BootStrap and moment. You can add events to a day planner and they will be saved to your local browser for later viewin. The display of the time blocks will also change depending on the time of day.
